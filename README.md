## 🌿 Overview

**Clicks of Nature** is a personal photography website built as a visual journal rather than a traditional studio portfolio.  
It’s a space to document quiet moments, nature, streets, and everyday stories — captured slowly, thoughtfully, and without rush.

This project focuses on:
- Emotion over perfection  
- Observation over staging  
- Storytelling through still frames  

The website is designed to feel calm, minimal, and human.
